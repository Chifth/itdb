ITDB is a web based asset inventory management tool used to store information 
about assets found in office environments, with a focus -but not lmited to- 
IT assets. It is not or targets for ITIL/CMDB compliance (yet), but it has 
served me for years and hopefully it will do the same for you :-)

ITDB comes with sources and is distributed under the GNU Public license.
